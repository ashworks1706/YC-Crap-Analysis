    "#### What is a pump and dump startup?\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"pump and dump\" startup is when some founders, who probably think they're the main character, just get to finessin' everyone. It’s giving classic scammer vibes, where they cap about their company being the next big thing. They flex about a fake business model and some sus-sounding tech, all to create a ton of hype.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then they get all the delulu investors to pile in, and the stock price goes crazy. It’s like, everyone gets FOMO, so they start throwing their money at it. But the founders, they're the ones getting the bag. Once the price is high-key bussin', they dump all their shares and dip. Everyone else is left with an L, and the company is basically canceled, periodt. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's giving the same energy as when a creator does a rug-pull on their own community. Like, they'll act all chill and pretend everything's gucci, but it's just a whole lot of cringe. They're not building anything real, they're just chasing clout and leaving everyone else cooked. So, if a startup seems too good to be true, it’s probably a hard pass.\n"

    "#### What do they have in common?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Weak user retention - The focus is on acquiring new \"investors\" (or users, in a crypto context) to drive up demand and price. Retention of these investors is not a goal; in fact, the goal is to sell to them before they realize the asset is worthless. An early product might have a massive number of users, but if the monthly active user (MAU) metric is growing much slower than total users or if the churn rate is high, the \"success\" is unsustainable.\n",
    " \n",
    "2. Valuation Growth To Revenue Ratio - The market cap (valuation) skyrockets based on false hype and manipulated trading activity, while legitimate revenue from a sustainable business model is minimal or nonexistent. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Unstable Growth Metrics - If the company fails to find a stable, repeatable growth engine, its trajectory will look more like an initial spike followed by decline.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Qualitative data over quantitative evidence - Early on, many YC companies lack hard quantitative data. They may pitch investors on \"founder's past experience,\" \"founder's attitude,\" or \"impressive technical milestones\" rather than proven revenue and retention. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Prioritizing network leverage over silent development - The scam relies on a network of people—often through spam emails, social media, or online forums—to spread misinformation and create false buying pressure. The \"development\" is purely in the manipulation of the market, not the product.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Over-emphasis on marketing and narrative - The entire business is the marketing. Fraudsters craft a compelling (but fake) narrative about a revolutionary product or impending breakthrough to manipulate the stock price. The product or company itself is merely an empty shell; all resources go into promotion.\n"

    "1. User retention - How many users does the product have on regular basis? The MAU/DAU metrics are critical for distinguishing legitimate startups from potential \"pump and dumps.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Market Cap - Valuation relative to revenue ratio. Excessively high valuations without corresponding revenue generation may signal hype-driven inflation rather than real value.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Cringe Linkedin/X Posts - Analysis of founders' communication style and marketing approach. Excessive hype, unrealistic promises, or misleading claims on social platforms can be red flags.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Funding Rounds - Pattern and timing of fundraising activities. Rapid, successive rounds without product milestones may indicate an emphasis on capital accumulation over business building.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. App Store Ratings / Reddit - External validation from actual users. Poor ratings, negative reviews, and critical discussions on platforms like Reddit can reveal discrepancies between marketing claims and product reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Founder's history - Track record of previous ventures, education background, and industry experience. Serial founders with failed ventures or founders lacking domain expertise may present higher risk."
