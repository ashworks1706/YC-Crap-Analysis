# YC Crap Analysis Backend

This is the backend for the YC Crap Analysis project. It provides data analysis and machine learning APIs to detect potential 'pump and dump' YC startups.

---

### Tech Stack
- Python 3.10+
- FastAPI (REST API framework)
- Pandas, scikit-learn (data/ML)
- Docker (optional, for containerization)
- AWS EC2 (or other cloud, for deployment)

---

### Roadmap / Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Define Problem & Criteria
- [ ] Read about 'pump and dump' startup patterns:
	- [YC Startup Grit: What Actually Matters](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/4A-what-makes-a-successful-yc-startup)
	- [YC Top Companies List](https://www.ycombinator.com/topcompanies)
	- [YC Demo Day Launches](https://www.ycombinator.com/launches)
- [ ] List features to extract, e.g.:
	- Funding amount (see Crunchbase, [YC Startup Directory](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies))
	- Team size (LinkedIn scraping)
	- Product type (YC company page)
	- Time to exit (news, Crunchbase)

#### 2. Data Collection
- [ ] Download YC startup lists:
	- [YC Startup Directory CSV](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/export)
	- [Crunchbase Free Export](https://data.crunchbase.com/docs/using-the-crunchbase-dataset)
- [ ] Scrape additional data (if needed):
	- Use [BeautifulSoup](https://realpython.com/beautiful-soup-web-scraper-python/) for web scraping
	- Use [SerpAPI](https://serpapi.com/) for Google/LinkedIn scraping (free tier)
- [ ] Clean and preprocess data (remove duplicates, handle missing values) using Pandas
- [ ] Store data as CSV or in SQLite (see [Pandas to CSV](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.to_csv.html))

#### 3. ML/Data Analysis Pipeline
- [ ] Feature engineering:
	- Funding amount, time to exit, founder backgrounds, etc.
	- See [Feature Engineering for ML](https://machinelearningmastery.com/discover-feature-engineering-how-to-engineer-features-and-how-to-get-good-at-it/)
- [ ] Choose ML model:
	- Start with [Logistic Regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html) or [Decision Tree](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html)
- [ ] Train/test model, evaluate accuracy (see [scikit-learn model selection](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/model_selection.html))
- [ ] Save model for inference using [joblib](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html)

#### 4. API Development
- [ ] Set up FastAPI project ([FastAPI Tutorial](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/))
- [ ] Create endpoints:
	- `/analyze` (POST): Accepts startup info, returns risk score & explanation
	- `/health` (GET): Health check
- [ ] Integrate ML model into API ([FastAPI ML Example](https://towardsdatascience.com/deploying-machine-learning-models-as-apis-with-fastapi-5e6c4f7e5aea))
- [ ] Add input validation and error handling ([Pydantic Docs](https://docs.pydantic.dev/))

#### 5. Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/)
- [ ] Test API endpoints with [httpx](https://www.python-httpx.org/) or Swagger UI (auto-generated by FastAPI)

#### 6. Containerization (Required)
- [ ] Write a [Dockerfile](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/deployment/docker/) for backend:
	- Use `python:3.10-slim` as base image
	- Copy code, install dependencies, expose port 8000
- [ ] Test locally with Docker:
	- Build: `docker build -t yc-backend .`
	- Run: `docker run -p 8000:8000 yc-backend`

#### 7. Cloud Deployment
- [ ] Set up [AWS EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html) instance (Ubuntu recommended)
- [ ] Install Docker on EC2 ([Docker Install Guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/))
- [ ] Copy your code to EC2 (use `scp` or GitHub)
- [ ] Build and run Docker container on EC2
- [ ] Open port 8000 in AWS Security Group
- [ ] Set up environment variables (API keys, DB URLs) in Docker or EC2

#### 8. Documentation
- [ ] Write API docs (OpenAPI/Swagger auto-generated by FastAPI, see `/docs` endpoint)
- [ ] Add usage examples (see [FastAPI Example Docs](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/first-steps/))
