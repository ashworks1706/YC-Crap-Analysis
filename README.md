## YC Crap Analysis

This project analyzes Y Combinator (YC) startups to identify potential 'pump and dump' startups using a combination of data analysis and machine learning.

### Project Roadmap / TODO

- [ ] Define criteria for 'pump and dump' startups
- [ ] Collect YC startup data (public sources, scraping, APIs)
- [ ] Design and implement backend (ML/data analysis, API)
- [ ] Build Next.js frontend (UI for analysis, input, results)
- [ ] Connect frontend to backend (API integration)
- [ ] Deploy backend (cloud, cost-effective options)
- [ ] Deploy frontend (Vercel/Netlify or similar)
- [ ] Add authentication (optional, for user features)
- [ ] Write documentation and polish UI
